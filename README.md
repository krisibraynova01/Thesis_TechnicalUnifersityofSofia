The data set I used is Customer Personality Analysis at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis

I went through all stages of data exploration using Python for data insights and analyzing customer behavior and clustering.

In addition, I made a Power BI dashboard to show different visualization techniques and visualizations I've used with Python as well as to show everything I've learned from the courses I've taken. I also made a quick guide on the main steps I followed in Power BI.

The 270 page documentation I made I can't upload here due to copyright and my university's rules but if you have any questions or content recommendations I remain available.

You can see the report in Power BI here: https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/61a9a9ad-2975-4e68-8453-272ec8d1d792/ReportSection?experience=power-bi
