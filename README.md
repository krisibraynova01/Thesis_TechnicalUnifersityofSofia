Project Title: Analysis of Customer Behavior and Segmentation by Machine Learning

Project Description:

During my academic journey, I undertook a comprehensive research project for my graduation thesis, focusing on the analysis of customer behavior and their segmentation through the application of machine learning techniques. This project allowed me to leverage data-driven insights to understand consumer preferences and optimize marketing strategies, ultimately contributing to improved business performance.

Key Achievements and Responsibilities:

- Data Collection and Preprocessing: The data set I used is Customer Personality Analysis at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis

- Feature Engineering: Conducted feature engineering to extract valuable insights from the raw data, enabling a more robust analysis.

- Machine Learning Models: Developed and implemented machine learning models such as clustering algorithms (K-Means) to segment customers based on their behavior and predict future actions.

- Data Visualization: Utilized data visualization tools (matplotlib, seaborn) to create meaningful visual representations of the results, making it easier to communicate findings and recommendations.

- Insight Generation: Interpreted and analyzed the results to derive actionable insights for business decision-making, including personalized marketing strategies and product recommendations.

- Thesis Writing: Compilation a comprehensive thesis paper that detailed the research methodology, findings, and conclusions, adhering to academic standards and guidelines.

- Presentation: Delivering a compelling presentation to a panel of professors and peers, effectively communicating the project's significance and key takeaways.

I went through all stages of data exploration using Python for data insights and analyzing customer behavior and clustering.

In addition, I made a Power BI dashboard to show different visualization techniques and visualizations I've used with Python as well as to show everything I've learned from the courses I've taken. I also made a quick guide on the main steps I followed in Power BI.

The 270 page documentation I made I can't upload here due to copyright and my university's rules but if you have any questions or content recommendations I remain available.

Outcome:

The project not only provided a deeper understanding of customer behavior but also demonstrated my proficiency in machine learning techniques, data analysis, and communication of complex technical concepts. The segmentation models I developed had practical applications in marketing and contributed to a more data-driven and customer-centric approach in business strategy.

This project enhanced my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and project management, and it reinforced my commitment to utilizing data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems. I look forward to applying these skills and experiences to contribute to data-driven decision-making and innovation in future roles.
